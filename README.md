# The FlossWare Java Library

![Build Status](http://flossware.no-ip.org:58080/buildStatus/icon?job=FlossWare-core&style=plastic)

*Warning this repo will be deprecated soon per [Issue #30] (https://github.com/FlossWare/core/issues/30).*  A new repo (or a few) will be written to replace this one to simplify life.  Worst case there will be one new repo with no submodules (will make using an IDE much simpler when navigating).
