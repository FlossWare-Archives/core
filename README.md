# The FlossWare Java Library

*Warning this repo will be deprecated soon per [Issue #30] (https://github.com/FlossWare/core/issues/30).*  A new repo (or a few will) will be written to replace this one to simplify life.  Worst case there will be one new repo with no submodules (will make using an IDE much simpler when navigating).
